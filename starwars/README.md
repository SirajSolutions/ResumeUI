# Starwars opening crawl, in CSS3 and HTML5

## Basically
A bit of fun doing the famous crawling text of Starwars. Nothing really major here, it uses transforms and animations from CSS3. I used Lea Verou's Prefixfree script (many thanks!) so I don't have to care about vendor prefixes (it is especially a pain with animations and keyframes). Audio is basic HTML5 with JS API

## Demo
